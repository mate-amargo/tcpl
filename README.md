# The C Programming Language

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language):

> The C Programming Language (sometimes termed K&R, after its authors' initials)
> is a computer programming book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie,
> the latter of whom originally designed and implemented the C programming
> language, as well as co-designed the Unix operating system with which
> development of the language was closely intertwined. The book was central to
> the development and popularization of C and is still widely read and used
> today. Because the book was co-authored by the original language designer, and
> because the first edition of the book served for many years as the de facto
> standard for the language, the book was regarded by many to be the
> authoritative reference on C.

This repo includes my solutions to the exercises proposed throughout the book.
